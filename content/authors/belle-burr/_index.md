I am responsible for the Visual Design for the OpenText Design System, an ever-growing collection of reusable components, patterns, and best practices that ensure consistent look and feel of experience across the companyâ€™s large suite of products. At OpenText, I have designed for a broad spectrum of software products and platforms as part of an in-house team of Interaction Designers, Visual Designers, and User Researchers.\

I am very passionate about Systems Thinking and meaningful connections between design elements. I'm also pretty passionate about meaningful connections between colleagues
